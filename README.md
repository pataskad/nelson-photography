*** Updated 02/19/21 ***

*I am currently working towards a February 26th, 2021 deployment with updates periodically afterwards as I expand my capabilities as a developer.  I am always open to constructive criticism and to learning new concepts and approaches! 

Pix by Jade is a photography portfolio website meant to serve as a continuous learning platform for myself while also being a live environment for the client to actually use.  This project will emulate a real working environment and accompanying paperwork to better prepare for working within the industry, alone or as an integrated member of a team, but this project is solely put together by myself, Dallas Pataska, credits will be updated immediately if this changes.  

*** Technologies/Ideas Incorporated ***
- HTML5/CSS3/Javscript
- In-line CSS use, primarily chose to do this because it tends to be the most direct and effective method to overriding bootstraps default applied settings
- CSS/JS via Bootstrap
- Django forms for contact form, currently via send_mail() - (Looking into django-crispy-forms or similar others for better front end facing form design/styling)
- Responsive Design heavily focused on combining desktop and mobile accessibility to lower the barrier to entry/viewing the website
- Python/Django backend
- Basic SEO implementations including use of Meta tags/description, header tags and favicon
  - Likely to go further later on in the project lifecycle (Such as blog updates, etc)


*** Features Implemented ***
- Single page design for ease of viewing, completely responsive design to operate fluidly across multiple browsers and the majority of devices on the market, mobile or desktop.

- Sticky top navbar to ensure user always has a constant, easy to find, navigation toolbar/navbar for navigating the different content sections    quicker.   
  - Further on navigation, an abstract approach: "The user should not have to guess or question what roads they can see and navigate, undoubtedly, it should be clear and labeled effectively enough to eliminate any confusion whatsoever" - Dallas Pataska :) 

- Effective use of color scheming and correct contrast selections to draw attention to the important Call to Actions (Book now, see portfolio, etc).

- Careful use of small implementations such as shadows and slight text color changes, or proper complimentary color branding for additional SEO, brand and design layout improvements (Polishing the fresh paint....)

- Testimonial section currently hard-coded --> *** May create an upload/submission form for custom reviews and automated upload process that will loop through each review ***

- Portfolio gallery using Javascript to loop through the photo collection smoothly on desktop and mobile devices as well as cross-browser support.

- Working contact form to start the business process of managing a client.  Due to low expected traffic many processes will be manually completed between the client and photographer.  

*** Upcoming goals ***
- Backend contact form configuration, update validations and styling to "clean up" the work surrounding the contact form in order to move on  *** Baseline config complete, moving to validations before spicing up styling / functionality ***
- Continue Further design improvements as needed/realized
  
- Apply SSL certificate to ensure customers that the brand is taking security serious, as well as add to the brands credibility
