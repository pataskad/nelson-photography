*** Deployed 03/05/21 ***

*I am currently working towards a February 28th, 2021 deployment with updates periodically afterwards as I expand my capabilities as a developer.  I am always open to constructive criticism and to learning new concepts and approaches! 

Pix by Jade is a photography portfolio website meant to serve as a continuous learning platform for myself while also being a live environment for the client to actually use.  This project will emulate a real working environment and accompanying paperwork to better prepare for working within the industry, alone or as an integrated member of a team, but this project is solely put together by myself, Dallas Pataska, credits will be updated immediately if this changes.  

*** Technologies/Ideas Incorporated ***
- HTML5/CSS3/Javascript
- In-line CSS use, primarily chose to do this because it tends to be the most direct and effective method to overriding bootstraps default applied settings
- CSS/JS via Bootstrap
- Django forms for contact form, currently via send_mail() - (Utilizing Bootstrap for front end viewing)
- Responsive Design heavily focused on combining desktop and mobile accessibility to lower the barrier to entry/viewing the website
- Python/Django backend configuration language and framework
- Basic SEO implementations including use of Meta tags/description, header tags and favicon
  - Likely to go further later on in the project lifecycle (Such as blog updates, etc)


*** Features Implemented \ Overview of pixbyjade ***
- Single page design for ease of viewing, completely responsive design to operate fluidly across multiple browsers and the majority of devices on the market, mobile or desktop.

- Sticky top navbar to ensure user always has a constant, easy to find, navigation toolbar/navbar for navigating the different content sections    quicker.   
  - Further on navigation, an abstract approach: "The user should not have to guess or question what roads they can see and navigate, undoubtedly, it should be clear and labeled effectively enough to eliminate any confusion whatsoever" - Dallas Pataska :) 

- Careful choice of color scheming to achieve effective contrast selections to draw attention to the important Call to Actions (Book now, see portfolio, etc).
- Careful use of small implementations such as shadows and slight text color changes, or proper complimentary color branding for additional SEO, brand and design layout improvements (Polishing the fresh paint....)

- Testimonial section currently hard-coded --> *** May create a private admin upload/submission form for custom reviews and automated upload process that will loop through each review ***

- Portfolio gallery using Javascript to loop through the photo collection smoothly on desktop and mobile devices as well as cross-browser support, currently (02/25/21) using pexels.com supplied images for high resolution until client supplies new images. 

- Functioning front and backend contact form with messages being sent to a website domain email inbox 

- Deployed project via AWS using NGINX web server and Gunicorn
- Applied SSL certificate utilizing the Certbox service


*** Upcoming goals ***

- Continue Further design improvements as needed/realized

- Refactor all HTML/CSS/JS where possible, add additional comments/documentation where necessary
