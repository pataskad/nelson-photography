*** Updated 02/04/21 ***

*I am currently working towards a February 2021 deployment with updates periodically afterwards as I expand my capabilities as a developer.  I am always open to constructive criticism and to learning to concepts! 

This project is a photography portfolio with a simple starting single page starting concept with the opportunity to expand and built upon as a continuous side project to put my knowledge on display and practice my skills in a live environment.

*** Technologies/Ideas Incorporated ***
- HTML
- CSS/JS via Bootstrap
- Responsive Design heavily focused on combining desktop and mobile accessibility to lower the barrier to entry/viewing the website
- Python/Django backend
- Basic SEO implementations including use of Meta tags/description, header tags and favicon
  - Likely to go further later on in the project lifecycle (Such as blog updates, etc)


*** Features Implemented ***
- Single page design for ease of viewing
- Sticky top navbar to ensure user always has a constant, easy to find, navigation toolbar/navbar for navigating the different content sections    quicker.   
  - Further on navigation, an abstract approach: "The user should not have to guess or question what roads they can see and navigate, it should be clear and labeled effectively to eliminate any doubt whatsoever" - Dallas Pataska :) 
- Effective use of color scheming and correct contrast selections to draw attention to the important Call to Actions (Book now, see portfolio, etc).
- Careful use of small implementations such as shadows and slight text color changes for additional SEO and design layout improvements (Polishing the fresh paint....)
- Raw testimonial section currently hard-coded (**Good potential for additions here, such as upload form for reviews for former clients to access**)
- Portfolio/Gallery for prior work (photo collection), this will be starting out as a simple grid layout with styling making things look better in the short term, but --> *** this is another area I am targeting to rapidly update post-deployment as I find the time ***

*** Upcoming goals ***
- Image gallery containing prior work/images
- Further design improvements as needed/realized
