This project is a photography portfolio with a simple starting single page starting concept with the opportunity to expand and built upon as a continuous side project to show off and practice my skills in a live environment.

I am currently working towards a February 2021 deployment with updates periodically afterwards as I expand my capabilities as a developer.  

Technologies Incorporated:
  -HTML
  -Bootstrap CSS (v4.1)
  -Responsive Design focused on desktop and mobile accessibility 
  -Python/Django backend
  -Basic SEO implementions including use of Meta tags/description, header tags and favicon
    - Likely to go further later on in the project lifecycle
